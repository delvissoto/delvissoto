<h2>Fire Resistive (Type I) Building Construction</h2>
   <p>A well-constructed building in which no structural steel is exposed and all vertical openings are protected.
Reinforced concrete, precast concrete, and protected steel frame construction meet the criteria for Type I construction.
Generally seen in high-rise residential and commercial buildings.</p> 
</nav>
<nav id= class2>
<h2>Non-Combustible (Type II) Building Construction</h2>
<P>Ordinarily composed of unprotected metal structural components.
    Often recognizable from the exterior. From the interior, evidence of unprotected steel at ceiling level is a giveaway.
    Metal framing members, metal cladding, or concrete-block construction of the walls with metal deck roofs supported by unprotected open-web joists are the most common forms of Type II construction.
    These structures have a one- to two-hour rating depending on building components (half rating of Type I)
    </P>
</nav>
<nav id= class3>
<h2>Ordinary (Type III) Building Construction</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Generally found in older schools, mercantile, business, and residential structures.</li>
        <li>Full dimensional lumber.</li>
        <li>Fire-cut joists (allow floors to collapse and masonry walls to remain standing).</li>
        <li>Exterior walls and structural members constructed of non-combustible materials.</li>
        <li>Interior walls, columns, beams, floors, and roofs are completely or partially constructed of wood.</li>
    </ul>
</nav>
<nav id= class4>
<h2>Heavy Timber (Type IV) Building Construction</h2>
<P>Constructed of solid structural members consisting of 6×6, 8×8, and larger dimensional lumber.
    Modern heavy timber structural members are often engineered by using laminated lumber. These members can fail much faster as the laminate glues that hold them together can degrade and vaporize under heat conditions is also 
    found in mill factories, barns, churches, new and renovated office spaces, etc.
    </P>
</nav>
<nav id= class5>
<h2>Wood Frame (Type V) Building Construction</h2>
<P>Used in the construction of single- and multiple-family dwellings, commercial, out buildings, etc.
    Interior wall coverings may be of plaster or drywall.
    May be composed of solid dimensional lumber (Legacy-allows for more burn time and better structural integrity under fire conditions).
    May be composed of engineered lightweight wood and laminate components (promotes rapid fire spread and reduced structural stability) used in ceiling and floor trusses, and other composite structural components.
    Platform, balloon, log, post and beam, and plank and beam are all forms of wood frame construction.</P>
